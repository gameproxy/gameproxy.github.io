## Can I be an admin?
If you know one of the GameProxy admins in real life (not _just_ through the
internet), you can ask them to submit a suggestion to the rest of the GameProxy
admins. You will need to go through the sign-up process and sign an agreement.

If you don't know a GameProxy admin in real life, unfortunately you can't sign
up to be an admin!
