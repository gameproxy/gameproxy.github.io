Hello, and welcome back to another GameProxy help article. Today, I'm going to explain how to upload games to GameProxy, right from when you have the file. If you would like to know what files you can upload to GameProxy, you can read this helpful article [here](https://gameproxy.github.io/help/?article=0001-supportedFileTypes).

If you go to the homepage of GameProxy and click on Account [here](https://gameproxy.github.io/account.html) or at the top of this page, you should be able to see an upload game box. If you add the name of your game, you can continue to the next step.


### Part 1: Game File Link


Firstly you need to get the game file link. If you do not already have the game file link online but only have it locally stored, you can choose from one of the following upload options:

* GitHub Repository

Once you have chose your option, you can scroll down the page until you find it.

If you have already got the game file link online though, you can add it to the box 'Game File URL' and skip to 'Part 2: Game Thumbnail'.

#### Upload using a GitHub Repository

If you would like, you can upload a game from a repository on your GitHub.

Firstly, if you sign into GitHub, click on the Plus icon and then New Repository. 

You should now see a page with the heading 'Create a new repository'. If you are not familiar with GitHub, a repository is a place where you can store files for your project or, in this case, your GameProxy uploads. If you enter GameProxy-gameFiles or something similar as your Repository name, leave the description box empty and make sure the repository is set to Public as this is needed later, you can click 'Create repository'.

After this, you should see a screen like below.

Underneath the text saying Quick Setup, you can click 'upload an existing file'. If you upload your files, leave the text boxes blank and click 'Commit'.

You should now see a screen with your game file on it. If you click on Settings and scroll down to GitHub pages, you can choose master branch from the drop down menu and click Save.

If you wait 10 seconds or so, refresh the page a couple of times and scroll down to GitHub pages again. It should say 'Your site is published at https://yourusername.github.io/... .

If you open that link in a new tab (It should say 404 Error) and then go back to your files list (Titled 'Code'), copy the file name and paste it in the URL bar. For me it would look something like below:

![Game File URL](/media/Help%20Centre/Article%200004/URL.PNG)

If you copy that link (this is important for later) and then go to it, it should ask you where you would like to save it or just download it anyway. This means that you have the correct game file link. If it doesn't work, check that the URL is correct. As you should have copied that link (if you didn't, you can go back to the previous step), if you go back to the upload page and paste the link in the textbox titled 'Game File URL', you are ready to move onto the next step. I know this can feel like it takes a while, but if you want to upload multiple games you can do it in less than 30 seconds. Good Job!


### Part 2: Thumbnail

Once you have your Game File URL, you can upload a thumbnail. There are several ways you can do this. You can:

#### Find an image on Google

If you search for an image on Google Images, you can right click on it and click 'Copy Image URL' and paste it in the textbox titled 'Thumbnail'. Easy as that.

#### Upload an image from your computer to Google Drive

This one's a bit more complicated than finding an image on Google, though if you follow my steps carefully this should work.

1. Upload the image to Google Drive, find it and double click on it.
2. Click on the 3 dots in the top right and then click 'Open in new window'.
3. If you right-click on the image and click 'Copy Image URL',
you can now paste it in the textbox titled 'Thumbnail'.

If you can't copy the image URL for some reason, you could try:

* Right clicking on the blank space and clicking 'Inspect'
* Pressing Ctrl + F on your keyboard and pasting 'ndfHFb-c4YZDc-HiaYvf-RJLb9c'.

It should have selected a bit of text below a URL. If you copy the URL above it (this is your image URL) and paste it into the 'Thumbnail' textbox on the GameProxy upload page, you can continue to the next step.


### Part 3: Description


You can write a description for your game in the textbox, and you can make *bold*, _italic_ and more as the text below says.


### Part 4: Upload!


You can now upload your game. We will check it soon, and if it passes our tests with no extreme violence, rude words, offencive material or other obvious requirements, we will verify it meaning you will get more views, likes and follows.

Hopefully this article helped with getting your first game uploaded and working. If you still have any questions, you can email us at [gameproxygames@gmail.com](mailto:gameproxygames@gmail.com). We will try to get back as soon as possible.
