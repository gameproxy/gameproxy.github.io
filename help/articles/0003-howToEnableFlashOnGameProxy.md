2. Click on the Padlock icon to the left of the URL and then click on Site Settings.

3. Change Flash from 'Ask (Default)' to 'Allow'.

    ![Click 'Load unsafe scripts'.](/media/Help%20Centre/Article%200003/Allowances.PNG)

4. If the game still doesn't load, you may see an icon like below to the right of your URL. Click it and then click on 'Load Unsafe Scripts'. We are working to fix this problem and make all sources HTTPS.

This should have fixed your problem. If not, feel free to send us an email or fill out the Report Form [here](https://gameproxy.github.io/report).
