                <p>
                    Smash Flash Knockout is the competition being run by
                    GameProxy that is centered around the hugely popular game
                    <em>Super Smash Flash 2</em>. Smash Flash is a clone of
                    Nintendo's paid game Smash Bros that anyone can play for
                    free on GameProxy. The game is proudly developed by
                    McLeodGaming Inc. and GameProxy owes huge amounts of thanks
                    to the developers of Smash Flash.

                    at 1:10 PM (just after lunch) on Friday 17th May. We'll

                    If you would like to spectate, just bring £1 to enter.
                    You won't be able to play, but you'll be able to watch
                    others play via the big screen where we'll show
                    screencasts.

                <p>
                    100% of the profits that are made on the day will be going
                    to charities ─ specifically Step into Tech and Make a Wish
                    Foundation. You are of course more than welcome to donate
                    more than the required amount!

                <h2 class="center">But what would I get if I win?!</h2>
                <p>
                    I knew you'd ask that question! That's why we've got some
                    pretty nice prizes lined up: lots of Cadburys chocolate,
                    some cool 3D-printed objects <em>and</em> some vouchers for
                    GameProxy Pro!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't worry if you do not win ─ participants who don't will
                    be getting a free 1 month GameProxy Pro voucher on us.
                    There's no reason <em>not</em> to play!
